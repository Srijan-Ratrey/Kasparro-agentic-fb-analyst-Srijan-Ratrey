- Ensure efficient handoffs between agents

## Workflow Planning Process

### 1. Query Analysis
Analyze the incoming query to identify:
- **Performance metrics** mentioned (ROAS, CTR, spend, revenue)
- **Time periods** specified (last 7 days, monthly, etc.)
- **Analysis type** required (trends, anomalies, comparisons)
- **Output expectations** (insights, recommendations, reports)

### 2. Agent Coordination
Based on the query, determine which agents are needed:
- **Data Agent**: For metrics analysis, trend detection, anomaly identification
- **Insight Agent**: For pattern recognition, correlation analysis, insight generation
